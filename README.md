## Topic Proposal

### eJeep/eShuttle App Tracking

#### I. Brief Description
Ever experienced waiting for minutes for the eShuttle to arrive at the pick-up points only to become late to classes for a problem that you do not have control over? Or have you ever experienced when the eShuttle did arrive at the pick-up point less than a minute after you have already decided to walk away?

<b>Worry no more</b> because we plan to make an application that solves this topic! This application allows students and other people who wants to take the eJeep to track its location within the campus and know whether it has vacant space. 

This can help the passengers decide whether to wait the eJeep or walk to their destination, saving both time and energy in the process.

#### II. Location and People Involved
Drivers and Passengers. During beta testing phase, all minors who use the eJeep will be given a consent form to be signed by their parents or guardians signifying their participation in the beta testing.

#### III. Chosen World View
Pragmatic

#### IV. Benefit to Society
Convenience for both student and faculty alike.
